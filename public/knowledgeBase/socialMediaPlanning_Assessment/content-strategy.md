# Content Strategy Blueprints

This document outlines blueprints for creating effective social media content.

## The AIDA Model for Content

A classic marketing framework that works wonders for social media content.

- **Attention:** Grab the viewer's attention within the first 3 seconds. Use a strong visual hook, a surprising statement, or a relatable problem.
- **Interest:** Keep them engaged by providing value. This could be through storytelling, sharing useful information, or entertainment.
- **Desire:** Create a desire for the product or service. Show how it solves a problem or enhances the user's life. Showcase benefits, not just features.
- **Action:** Tell the audience exactly what to do next. Use a clear Call to Action (CTA), such as "Shop Now," "Learn More," "Comment Below," or "Follow for more."

## Blueprint for a 15-Second Instagram Reel / TikTok

- **Seconds 0-2 (Attention):** A dynamic shot with fast movement. Example: Pouring a colorful drink, a quick unboxing, or a dramatic landscape reveal.
- **Seconds 3-12 (Interest & Desire):** A sequence of 3-4 quick cuts showing the product in an aspirational context. Example: People enjoying the drink at a party, the product being used in a beautiful setting. Add text overlays highlighting key benefits.
- **Seconds 13-15 (Action):** End on a clear shot of the product with a strong Call to Action on screen and in the caption.
