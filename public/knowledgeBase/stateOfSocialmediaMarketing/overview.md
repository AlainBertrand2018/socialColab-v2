# State of Social Media Marketing in Mauritius

This document provides an overview of the social media marketing landscape in Mauritius.

## Key Platforms

- **Facebook:** Remains the most popular platform, with a wide demographic reach. Ideal for community building and local business advertising.
- **Instagram:** Hugely popular with the 18-35 demographic. It is the primary platform for visual-first brands, influencers, fashion, and lifestyle content.
- **TikTok:** Rapidly growing, especially among users under 25. Excellent for short-form video, trends, and viral content.
- **LinkedIn:** The primary platform for B2B marketing, professional networking, and corporate branding.

## Trends

- **Video Content is King:** Short-form video (Reels, TikToks) has the highest engagement rates.
- **Authenticity Over Polish:** Users are more receptive to genuine, less-polished content from creators than to overly-produced corporate ads.
- **Micro-influencers on the Rise:** Brands are finding high ROI by collaborating with smaller, niche influencers who have a highly engaged and trusting audience.
