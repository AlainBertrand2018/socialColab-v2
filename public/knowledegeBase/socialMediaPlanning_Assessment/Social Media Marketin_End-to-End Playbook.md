# Planning, Measuring & Optimizing Social + Influencer Marketing (Global & Mauritian Context) {#planning-measuring-optimizing-social-influencer-marketing-global-mauritian-context .unnumbered}

A staged, practical methodology you can run as a checklist---from
strategy to ROI---adapted to small-market dynamics (Mauritius/Indian
Ocean) and scalable to regional/global campaigns. Sources cited inline.

## Strategy Snapshot (why this flow works)

-   Tie social/influencer work to business objectives and SMART goals;
    iterate via test-measure-learn loops.

-   Anchor planning in market realities (audience size, platform
    penetration, cultural/linguistic nuance). For Mauritius, social
    media users ≈ 63% of population (Jan 2024); continued growth into
    2025.

-   Operate transparently (disclosure), protect IP/usage rights, and log
    explicit usage/whitelisting in contracts.

## Business Objectives → SMART Goals

### Deliverables {#deliverables .unnumbered}

-   One-page Campaign Charter: business outcome, audience, problem
    statement, time frame, budget guardrails, success definition.

-   2 to 4 SMART goals mapped to funnel stages (Awareness,
    Consideration, Conversion, Loyalty).

-   Primary & secondary KPIs per goal.

### How-to {#how-to .unnumbered}

1.  Translate business goals into measurable social goals (e.g., +15%
    aided awareness in 8 weeks; 2,000 trial signups at ≤ MUR X CAC). Use
    SMART structure.

2.  Pre-define KPI ladders per funnel stage (Awareness:
    Reach/Impressions; Consideration: Video Thru-Plays, Saves;
    Conversion: Leads/Sales/Installs; Loyalty: Repeat rate/UGC volume).

3.  Set pass/fail "gates" for midpoint optimisation (e.g., if ER \< 3%
    by week 2, pivot creative).

## Audience Definition & Personas

### Deliverables {#deliverables-1 .unnumbered}

-   2--5 research-backed personas (demographics, psychographics,
    pains/gains, language preference, platform habits, creator
    affinities).

-   "Jobs-to-be-done" statements + content triggers/motivations.

### How-to {#how-to-1 .unnumbered}

-   Mine your analytics + desk research to size the addressable base per
    platform. (Mauritius: Instagram \~26% of population in 2023; check
    current snapshot before activation.)

-   Document language/cultural nuance (MU is
    multilingual---EN/FR/Creole---factor this into scripts, captions,
    subtitles).

-   Build decision drivers + barriers; align content formats
    accordingly. Persona-targeted creative systematically outperforms
    generic messaging.

## Channel Strategy (B2C & B2B)

### Deliverables {#deliverables-2 .unnumbered}

-   Channel role chart (Core / Support / Test), with audience fit,
    formats, and KPIs per network.

-   Posting windows (local time) and frequency bands.

### Guidance {#guidance .unnumbered}

-   B2C: Instagram/Reels, TikTok (short-form, UGC), Facebook (mass
    reach/events), YouTube (how-tos/reviews).

-   B2B: LinkedIn (thought leadership, lead gen), webinars/podcasts
    (depth), YouTube long-form.

-   Select channels by audience concentration + format fit, then set
    KPIs: e.g., Reels/TikTok → ER, Thru-Plays; LinkedIn → CTR, lead form
    CVR.

-   Size reality check (Mauritius): validate platform reach before
    planning flighting and caps using

## Influencer Strategy & Shortlisting

### Deliverables {#deliverables-3 .unnumbered}

-   Creator matrix: Tier, niche, audience geo/age/gender split,
    authenticity score, historic ER, brand-fit notes, pricing,
    deliverables.

-   Shortlist (A/B/C) with backups.

### How-to {#how-to-2 .unnumbered}

-   Define tier mix by objective & budget:

    -   Nano (\<5k): trust & UGC;

    -   Micro (5k--50k): niche scale + highest ER;

    -   Mid/Macro (50k+): reach & PR value. (Micro creators consistently
        deliver strong engagement/efficiency.)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Due diligence: verify audience authenticity (geo mismatch spikes,
    bot-like comments), past brand safety, disclosure history, and
    content quality.

-   Fit-first outreach: brief the problem to solve and non-negotiables;
    protect creative voice to preserve authenticity.

-   Rate benchmarking (global ranges; calibrate locally):

    -   IG post: nano \~\$25--150; mid-tier \~\$160--1,800; mega
        \$1,200+ (avg minima).

    -   Use bundles (posts+stories+reels) and usage-rights pricing; log
        whitelisting terms.

Note (Mauritius): Expect smaller follower ceilings; prioritise
fit/engagement over raw reach. Validate local success cases (e.g.,
domestic tourism campaigns) when arguing for micro networks.

## Creative & Content System

### Deliverables {#deliverables-4 .unnumbered}

-   Messaging house (Core promise → Proofs → RTBs → CTAs).

-   Format map by channel (Short-form video, Carousels, Stories/Live,
    Long-form video, Blogs/Pods).

-   Content calendar + asset checklist (bilingual captions, SRT
    subtitles, vertical crops, alt text).

### Guidance {#guidance-1 .unnumbered}

-   Short-form video continues to rank among the most impactful
    influencer formats; plan for vertical-first creative (9:16), hooks
    in first 2--3s, captions on.

-   Carousels and how-tos excel for saves and session time; long-form
    (YouTube/LinkedIn) for depth and B2B proof.

-   Cultural timing in MU (festivals/seasonality) boosts relevance;
    local language snippets increase affinity. (Validate against
    platform analytics each cycle.)

## Budgeting & Commercials

### Deliverables {#deliverables-5 .unnumbered}

-   Bottom-up budget (talent fees, production, paid amplification,
    tools, contingencies).

-   Influencer SOW + Rate table + Rights/whitelisting schedule.

### Guidance {#guidance-2 .unnumbered}

-   Use CPM/CPE to compare creator options objectively; many micro
    creators outperform on cost-per-result.

-   10--30% of budget to paid amplification (best-performing creator
    assets through Spark/whitelisted ads) to scale beyond organic
    followers.

-   Price benchmarks to open negotiation, not to cap value .

## Legal, Disclosure & Rights

### Deliverables {#deliverables-6 .unnumbered}

-   One-page disclosure standard (e.g., \*#ad/Paid Partnership,
    first-line, clear & conspicuous; verbal + on-screen for video).

-   Master Influencer Agreement: deliverables, approvals, deadlines,
    exclusivity, usage/whitelisting, takedown, morality clause, IP
    warranties, data/privacy, invoicing.

-   Music/asset licensing checklist.

### Standards & Sources {#standards-sources .unnumbered}

-   Follow FTC Endorsement Guides & "Disclosures 101"---even if
    operating ex-US, they're the global gold-standard for clarity.

## Execution Workflow

### Deliverables {#deliverables-7 .unnumbered}

-   Timeline (onboarding → concept → draft → QA → publish → mid-flight
    optimization → wrap).

-   Roles/RACI, approval SLAs (≤48h), escalation paths.

-   Live dashboard (KPIs per asset/creator/channel).

### How-to {#how-to-3 .unnumbered}

-   Onboard creators via live briefing; provide problem, principles,
    must-haves, not scripts.

-   Draft review for accuracy & compliance; protect creator voice for
    authenticity.

-   Schedule posts to local peak windows; align to launch "moments"
    (events/promos).

-   Monitor in real time; fix tags/links/disclosure immediately; engage
    in comments.

-   Mid-flight: reallocate budget to winning assets; iterate hooks/CTAs.
    (Plan to test 2--3 creative hypotheses minimum.)

## Measurement Framework (KPIs & Diagnostics)

### Deliverables {#deliverables-8 .unnumbered}

-   KPI map + targets per goal (Awareness, Consideration, Conversion,
    Loyalty).

-   Tracking plan: UTMs, promo codes, platform pixels/API connections,
    CRM tags.

### Key Metrics {#key-metrics .unnumbered}

-   Awareness: Reach, Impressions, VTR (video thru-rate), unique
    frequency; brand lift (if study feasible).

-   Engagement: ER (by reach), saves/shares/comments (weighted),
    sentiment.

-   Traffic: Link clicks, session quality (time, bounce, assisted
    conversions).

-   Conversion: Leads, sign-ups, purchases, installs; CPA/CAC; revenue.

-   Creator Diagnostics: ER vs. tier, CTR, CVR, CPE/CPM per asset;
    creative element analysis (hook, length, CTA).

### Set-up & Best Practice {#set-up-best-practice .unnumbered}

-   Define KPIs up front; instrument UTMs and conversion events; build a
    single source-of-truth report.

## Attribution & ROI

### Deliverables {#deliverables-9 .unnumbered}

-   Working attribution model + assumptions (first/last-click, linear,
    time-decay, position-based).

-   ROI & efficiency report (ROI, ROAS, CAC, CPM/CPE/CPC) per channel
    and creator.

### How-to {#how-to-4 .unnumbered}

-   Start simple (last-click on codes/links) + add multi-touch
    perspective (time-decay or U-shape) for a fairer view of influencer
    assist.

-   Use post-purchase survey ("How did you hear about us?") to capture
    view-through influence.

-   Calculate ROI: (Attributed Revenue − Total Cost) ÷ Cost; complement
    with EMV (earned media value) where direct revenue is not primary
    objective.

-   Benchmark and communicate that top-of-funnel influencer value is
    often under-credited by last-click alone; align expectations
    accordingly.

## Optimisation & Learning Loop

### Deliverables {#deliverables-10 .unnumbered}

-   Post-mortem with wins, gaps, surprises; next-cycle hypotheses.

-   Creator roster decisions (double-down, coach, replace).

-   Playbook updates (messaging house, hooks, visual system, timing
    windows).

### How-to {#how-to-5 .unnumbered}

-   Pivot inputs that under-delivered (hook length, first-frame visual,
    CTA position).

-   Scale what worked (top creators/assets) with paid; expand to
    lookalikes.

-   Localise deeper: language variants, festival tie-ins,
    island-specific micro-communities.

-   Refresh measurement: elevate a metric if it better aligns to the
    business goal next cycle (e.g., from ER → Saves/Leads).
